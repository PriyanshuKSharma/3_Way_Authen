## One-Time Password (OTP) Implementation
# About
This project provides a secure and efficient implementation of One-Time Password (OTP) functionality for user authentication and sensitive action verification. OTPs are temporary codes that provide an additional layer of security, commonly used for two-factor authentication (2FA) in various applications.

# Features
Supports both Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) and HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithms.
Customizable OTP length and expiry duration for enhanced security.
Easy integration into existing applications or systems.
Secure storage and transmission of OTPs to prevent unauthorized access.
Robust error handling and retry mechanisms for a seamless user experience.
Installation
To use this OTP implementation in your project, follow these steps:

# Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
``` git clone https://github.com/your-username/otp-implementation.git

Integrate the OTP generation and validation logic into your application codebase.
Install any required dependencies or libraries specified in the project documentation.
Customize OTP settings such as length and expiry duration according to your requirements.
Ensure secure storage and transmission of OTPs within your application.
Usage
Generate OTP: When a user attempts to log in or perform a sensitive action, generate an OTP using the provided functions.
Send OTP: Send the generated OTP to the user via their preferred communication channel (e.g., SMS, email, app notification).
Verify OTP: Prompt the user to input the OTP they received and validate it against the OTP generated by the server.
Handle Expiry and Errors: Implement logic to handle cases where the OTP entered by the user is incorrect or has expired.
